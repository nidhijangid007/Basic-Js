    <!-- Operators
    There are following types of operators in JavaScript.
    1.Arithmetic Operators
    2.Comparison (Relational) Operators
    3.Logical Operators
    4.Assignment Operators
    5.Bitwise Operators
    6.Increment/Decrement Operators
    7.Ternary Operators-->

    <!-- 1.Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on the operands.
    The following operators are known as JavaScript arithmetic operators.
    Operator	Description	        Example
        +	        Addition	    10+20 = 30
        -	       Subtraction	    20-10 = 10
        *	     Multiplication	    10*20 = 200
        /	        Division	    20/10 = 2
        %	   Modulus (Remainder)	20%10 = 0-->
       

        <!-- 2.Comparison operator compares the two operands.
        The comparison operators are as follows:

    Operator	Description	            Example
        ==	    Is equal to	            10==20 = false
        ===	    Identical   	        10==20 = false
                (equal and of same Datatype)
        !=	    Not equal to	        10!=20 = true
        !==	    Not Identical	        20!==20 = false
        >	    Greater than	        20>10 = true
        >=	    Greater than equal to	20>=10 = true
        <	    Less than	            20<10 = false
        <=	    Less than or equal to	20<=10 = false -->


        <!-- 3.Logical Operators
        The following operators are known as JavaScript logical operators.

    Operator	Description	    Example
        &&	    Logical AND	    (10==20 && 20==33) = false
            (Both condition must be true)

        ||	    Logical OR	    (10==20 || 20==33) = false
            (Any one condition can be true)

        !	    Logical Not	    !(10==20) = true
            (It reverse the condition) -->


        <!-- 4.Assignment Operators
        The following operators are known as JavaScript assignment operators.

    Operator	Description	            Example
        =	    Assign	                10+10 = 20
        +=	    Add and assign	        var a=10; a+=20; Now a = 30
        -=	    Subtract and assign	    var a=20; a-=10; Now a = 10
        *=	    Multiply and assign	    var a=10; a*=20; Now a = 200
        /=	    Divide and assign	    var a=10; a/=2; Now a = 5
        %=	    Modulus and assign	    var a=10; a%=2; Now a = 0 -->

        <!-- 5.Bitwise operators perform bitwise operations on operands.
        The bitwise operators are as follows:

    Operator	Description	                    Example
        &	    Bitwise AND	                    (10==20 & 20==33) = false
        |	    Bitwise OR	                    (10==20 | 20==33) = false
        ^	    Bitwise XOR	                    (10==20 ^ 20==33) = false
        ~	    Bitwise NOT	                    (~10) = -10
        <<	    Bitwise Left Shift	            (10<<2) = 40
        >>	    Bitwise Right Shift	            (10>>2) = 2
        >>>	    Bitwise Right Shift with Zero	(10>>>2) = 2 -->    

        <!-- 6.Increment/Decrement Operators
        The following operators are known as JavaScript assignment operators.
    Operator	Description	        Example
        a++	     Post Increment	    var a=10; a++; Now a = 10
        a--	     Post Decrement	    var a=10; a--; Now a = 10
        ++a	     Pre Increment	    var a=10; ++a; Now a = 11
        --a	     Pre Decrement	    var a=10; --a; Now a = 9 -->

        <!-- 7.Ternary Operator (Conditional Operator) is a concise way to write a conditional (if-else) statement.
        Ternary Operator takes three operands i.e. condition, true value and false value.
        Operator(Syntax):-	                                    	        
        (condition)? trueExpression : falseExpression

        Description:-
        condition:      Expression to be evaluated which returns a boolean value.
        value if true:  Value to be executed if the condition results in a true state.
        value if false: Value to be executed if the condition results in a false state.

        Example:-
        Input: let result = (10 > 0) ? true : false;
                console.log(result);
        Output: true

        Input: let message = (20 > 15) ? "Yes" : "No";
                console.log(message);
        Output: Yes -->
