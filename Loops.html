    /*LOOPS
    The JavaScript loops are used to iterate the piece of code using for,
    while, do while or for-in loops.
    It makes the code compact. It is mostly used in array.
    There are four types of loops in JavaScript.

    1.for loop
    2.while loop
    3.do-while loop
    4.for-in loop*/

    /*1.FOR LOOP
    The JavaScript for loop iterates the elements for the fixed number of times.
    It should be used if number of iteration is known.
    The syntax of for loop is given below.

    SYNTAX:-
    for (initialization; condition; increment)  
    {  
        code to be executed  
    }

    EXAMPLE of For Loops:-
    let i;
    for(i=1; i<6 ; i++){
        console.log(i);
    }
    // REVERSE VALUE
    for (i=10;i>=0;i--)
    {
        console.log(i);
    }*/

    /*2.WHILE LOOP
    The JavaScript while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times.
    It should be used if number of iteration is not known.
    The syntax of while loop is given below.

    SYNTAX:-
    declaration of variable
    while (condition)  
    {  
        code to be executed;
        increment/decrement operator 
    }


    EXAMPLE while loop:-
    let j = 6;
    while(j<11){
        console.log(j);
        j++;

    }*/

    /*3.DO WHILE LOOP
    The JavaScript do while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times like while loop.
    But, code is executed at least once whether condition is true or false.
    The syntax of do while loop is given below.

    SYNTAX:-
    do
    {  
        code to be executed
        increment/decrement operator   
    }
    while (condition);  

    EXAMPLES:-
    let k = 11;
    do {
        console.log(k);
        k++;
    }
    while (k<16)*/

    /*4.FOR IN LOOP
    let data = {
                name : "veer",
                age : 30,
                }
    for (let key in data)
    {
        console.log(data[key]);
    }*/

    /*5.FOR OF LOOP
    let info = {
                name : "Neel ",
                age : 20,
                }
    for (let key of Object.keys(info))
    {
        console.log(info[key]);
    }*/
